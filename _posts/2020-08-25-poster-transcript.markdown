**TITLE:** Tip-Toe Through the Tear Gas (with me)

*[Reading from left to right, top to bottom]*

CAUTION: Long term exposure may cause "Blindness, Glaucoma, Immediate
death due to severe chemical burns to the throat, lungs, Respiratory
failure possibly resulting in death" -- CDC (1)

The goal of CS GAS is PAIN COMPLIANCE

"The intent was to use [tear gas] once to disperse a crowd - not to
expose someone daily for several months. [So, what other impacts are
there?] WE DON'T KNOW." -- Dr. R. Hendriksen (2). It certainly impacts
the reproductive system.

"IT'S A POISONOUS GAS" -- Dr. R. Haar (3)

"COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE" -- S. Jordt (3)

"THIS FEELS LIKE AN ATTACK ON EVERYBODY. It doesn't matter who you are
or where you are in the city; IT FEELS LIKE A BOMB WENT OFF IN THE
CITY." -- A non-protesting Portlander forced to leave her home due to
tear gas contamination (4)

"Even the Army realized they had done something wrong and that this
was more toxic than they thought before" -- S. Jordt (5)

but... PPB doesn't care...

END POLICE BRUTALITY

"THEY'RE DEPLOYING PRE-9/11 GAS ON KIDS ... GAS MADE BEFORE THESE KIDS
WERE BORN" (6)

*[In small text]* Tear gas breaks down into even nastier chemicals
over time. Most tear gas expired about five years after its date of
manufacture.

Tear gas causes panic. It's like turning on all the pain receptors in
your face. Your nose and mouth start oozing snot -- not a little --
your whole face is pouring liquid. The more you breathe, the more you
feel like you can't breathe. It chokes you. It's a terrifying feeling,
like there's not enough air. It makes your stomach cramp. It makes you
vomit. Sometimes for days after your stomach is upset and you can't
draw a full breath. The scent follows you. You smell it everywhere. 

TEAR GAS TEDDY: Mayor of Portland, Police Commissioner, Overseeing 80
nights of gassing and counting...

Studies have shown that a SINGLE exposure to tear gas increases
susceptibility to RESPIRATORY ILLNESS.

*[Image of Ted Wheeler, with word balloon emerging from his mouth:]*
"Nasty stuff... [when feds gas] it is unconscionable" (8).
